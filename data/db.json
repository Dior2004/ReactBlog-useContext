      "body": "Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.\n\nAmong Web professionals, \"Web development\" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.\n\nFor larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.[3] Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers. Since the commercialization of the Web with Tim Berners-Lee[4] developing the World Wide Web at CERN, the industry has boomed and has become one of the most used technologies ever.",

      "title": "HTML5",
      "body": "HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and final[3] major HTML version that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard. It is maintained by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft).\n\nHTML5 was first released in a public-facing form on 22 January 2008,[2] with a major update and \"W3C Recommendation\" status in October 2014.[4][5] Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with older software. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4 but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.[6]\n\nHTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, improves, and rationalizes the markup available for documents and introduces markup and application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications.[7] For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a candidate for cross-platform mobile applications because it includes features designed with low-powered devices in mind.\n\nMany new syntactic features are included. To natively include and handle multimedia and graphical content, the new <video>, <audio> and <canvas> elements were added, expandable sections are natively implemented through <summary>...</summary> and <details>...</details> rather than depending on CSS or JavaScript, and support for scalable vector graphics (SVG) content and MathML for mathematical formulas was also added. To enrich the semantic content of documents, new page structure elements such as <main>, <section>, <article>, <header>, <footer>, <aside>, <nav>, and <figure> are added. New attributes were introduced, some elements and attributes were removed, and others such as <a>, <cite>, and <menu> were changed, redefined, or standardized. The APIs and Document Object Model (DOM) are now fundamental parts of the HTML5 specification,[7] and HTML5 also better defines the processing for any invalid documents.[8]",

      "title": "Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)",
      "body": "Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]\n\nCSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.\n\nSeparation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]\n\nThe name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.\n\nThe CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.[5]\n\nIn addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.",

For the Microsoft dialect used in Internet Explorer, see JScript.\n\"Live script\" redirects here. For the programming notebook paradigm, see MATLAB.\nJavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.\n\nJavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[10] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).\n\nThe ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.\n\nJavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.\n\nAlthough Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.",

It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.[4][5][6] React can be used as a base in the development of single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.[7][8]",

      "body": "React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook, who released an early prototype of React called \"FaxJS\".[32][33] He was influenced by XHP, an HTML component library for PHP. It was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and later on Instagram in 2012.[34] It was open-sourced at JSConf US in May 2013.[33]\n\nReact Native, which enables native Android, iOS, and UWP development with React, was announced at Facebook's React Conf in February 2015 and open-sourced in March 2015.\n\nOn April 18, 2017, Facebook announced React Fiber, a new set of internal algorithms for rendering, as opposed to React's old rendering algorithm, Stack.[35] React Fiber was to become the foundation of any future improvements and feature development of the React library.[36][needs update] The actual syntax for programming with React does not change; only the way that the syntax is executed has changed.[37] React's old rendering system, Stack, was developed at a time when the focus of the system on dynamic change was not understood. Stack was slow to draw complex animation, for example, trying to accomplish all of it in one chunk. Fiber breaks down animation into segments that can be spread out over multiple frames. Likewise, the structure of a page can be broken into segments that may be maintained and updated separately. JavaScript functions and virtual DOM objects are called \"fibers\", and each can be operated and updated separately, allowing for smoother on-screen rendering.[38]\n\nOn September 26, 2017, React 16.0 was released to the public.[39]\n\nOn February 16, 2019, React 16.8 was released to the public.[40] The release introduced React Hooks.[41]\n\nOn August 10, 2020, the React team announced the first release candidate for React v17.0, notable as the first major release without major changes to the React developer-facing API.[42]\n\nOn March 29, 2022, React 18 was released which introduced a new concurrent renderer, automatic batching and support for server side rendering with Suspense.[43]",

      "title": "Node.js",
      "body": "Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on a JavaScript Engine (i.e. V8 engine) and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser, which was designed to build scalable network applications. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a \"JavaScript everywhere\" paradigm,[6] unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts.\n\nNode.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games).[7]\n\nThe Node.js distributed development project was previously governed by the Node.js Foundation,[8] and has now merged with the JS Foundation to form the OpenJS Foundation, which is facilitated by the Linux Foundation's Collaborative Projects program.[9]\n\nNode.js was written initially by Ryan Dahl in 2009,[24] about thirteen years after the introduction of the first server-side JavaScript environment, Netscape's LiveWire Pro Web.[25] The initial release supported only Linux and Mac OS X. Its development and maintenance was led by Dahl and later sponsored by Joyent.[26]\n\nDahl criticized the limited possibilities of the most popular web server in 2009, Apache HTTP Server, to handle a lot of concurrent connections (up to 10,000 and more) and the most common way of creating code (sequential programming), when code either blocked the entire process or implied multiple execution stacks in the case of simultaneous connections.[27]\n\nDahl demonstrated the project at the inaugural European JSConf on November 8, 2009.[28][29][30] Node.js combined Google's V8 JavaScript engine, an event loop, and a low-level I/O API.[31]\n\nIn January 2010, a package manager was introduced for the Node.js environment called npm.[32] The package manager makes it easier for programmers to publish and share source code of Node.js packages and is designed to simplify installation, updating, and uninstallation of packages.[31]\n\nIn June 2011, Microsoft and Joyent implemented a native Windows version of Node.js.[33] The first Node.js build supporting Windows was released in July 2011.\n\nIn January 2012, Dahl stepped aside, promoting coworker and npm creator Isaac Schlueter to manage the project.[34] In January 2014, Schlueter announced that Timothy J. Fontaine would lead the project.[35]\n\nIn December 2014, Fedor Indutny started io.js, a fork of Node.js. Due to the internal conflict over Joyent's governance, io.js was created as an open governance alternative with a separate technical committee.[36][37] Unlike Node.js,[38] the authors planned to keep io.js up-to-date with the latest releases of the Google V8 JavaScript engine.[39]\n\nIn February 2015, the intent to form a neutral Node.js Foundation was announced. By June 2015, the Node.js and io.js communities voted to work together under the Node.js Foundation.[40]\n\nIn September 2015, Node.js v0.12 and io.js v3.3 were merged back together into Node v4.0.[41] This merge brought V8 ES6 features into Node.js and a long-term support release cycle.[42] As of 2016, the io.js website recommends that developers switch back to Node.js and that no further releases of io.js are planned due to the merge.[43]\n\nIn 2019, the JS Foundation and Node.js Foundation merged to form the OpenJS Foundation.\n\nIn September 2022, Node.js 18.9.0 was released.[44]\n\nOverview\nNode.js allows the creation of Web servers and networking tools using JavaScript and a collection of \"modules\" that handle various core functionalities.[28][31][45][46][47] Modules are provided for file system I/O, networking (DNS, HTTP, TCP, TLS/SSL, or UDP), binary data (buffers), cryptography functions, data streams, and other core functions.[31][46][48] Node.js's modules use an API designed to reduce the complexity of writing server applications.[31][46]\n\nJavaScript is the only language that Node.js supports natively, but many compile-to-JS languages are available.[49] As a result, Node.js applications can be written in CoffeeScript,[50] Dart, TypeScript, ClojureScript and others.\n\nNode.js is primarily used to build network programs such as Web servers.[45] The most significant difference between Node.js and PHP is that most functions in PHP block until completion (commands execute only after previous commands finish), while Node.js functions are non-blocking (commands execute concurrently or even in parallel,[51][52] and use callbacks to signal completion or failure).[45]\n\nNode.js is officially supported on Linux, macOS and Microsoft Windows 8.1 and Server 2012 (and later),[3] with tier 2 support for SmartOS and IBM AIX and experimental support for FreeBSD. OpenBSD also works, and LTS versions available for IBM i (AS/400).[53] The provided source code may also be built on similar operating systems to those officially supported or be modified by third parties to support others such as NonStop OS[54] and Unix servers.\n\nPlatform architecture\nNode.js brings event-driven programming to web servers, enabling development of fast web servers in JavaScript.[31] Developers can create scalable servers without using threading, by using a simplified model of event-driven programming that uses callbacks to signal the completion of a task.[31] Node.js connects the ease of a scripting language (JavaScript) with the power of Unix network programming.[31]\n\nNode.js was built on top of Google's V8 JavaScript engine since it was open-sourced under the BSD license. It is proficient with internet fundamentals such as HTTP, DNS, and TCP.[28] JavaScript was also a well-known language, making Node.js accessible to the web development community.[28]\n\nIndustry support\nThere are thousands of open-source libraries for Node.js, most of them hosted on the npm website. There are multiple developer conferences and events that support the Node.js community, including NodeConf, Node Interactive, and Node Summit as well as a number of regional events.\n\nThe open-source community has developed web frameworks to accelerate the development of applications. Such frameworks include Connect, Express.js, Socket.IO, Feathers.js, Koa.js, Hapi.js, Sails.js, Meteor, Derby, and many others.[31][55] Various packages have also been created for interfacing with other languages or runtime environments such as Microsoft .NET.[56]\n\nModern desktop IDEs provide editing and debugging features specifically for Node.js applications. Such IDEs include Atom, Brackets, JetBrains WebStorm,[57][58] Microsoft Visual Studio (with Node.js Tools for Visual Studio,[59] or TypeScript with Node definitions,[60][61][62][63]) NetBeans,[64] Nodeclipse Enide Studio[65] (Eclipse-based), and Visual Studio Code.[66][67] Certain online web-based IDEs also support Node.js, such as Codeanywhere, Codenvy, Cloud9 IDE, Koding, and the visual flow editor in Node-RED.\n\nNode.js is supported across a number of cloud-hosting platforms like Jelastic, Google Cloud Platform, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Joyent and others.",
